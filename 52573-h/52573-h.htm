</div>

<p class='c009'>It has been the misfortune of Rhode Island
to have had its earlier history written
and read under the bias of prejudices engendered
by the controversies which led to its
settlement. Justice has not yet been done
to the prescience and statesmanship of the
remarkable men who were the builders of
the first Commonwealth in the world’s history
dedicated to Soul Liberty.</p>

<p class='c010'>Among these men, none were possessed of
a personality more striking and picturesque
than the subject of this paper, Samuell Gorton.
The cordial reception of this brief historical
sketch by the distinguished audience
which gave it a hearing before the Rhode
Island Historical Society has induced me to
consent to its publication. It has since been
carefully revised, and a few doubtful points
have been cleared up as well as the character
of all available data will permit.</p>

<p class='c010'>I am indebted to Mr. William D. Ely and
Mr. Charles Gorton, of Providence, and Mr.
Adelos Gorton, of Philadelphia, for valuable
aid and suggestion in perfecting this revision.
It is hoped that the publication may stimulate
further research in the interesting field
of our Colonial history. A native of Rhode
Island, the writer traces his ancestry by two
distinct lines to the Mayflower, while the
first of his family name in America was one
of the earliest settlers of the New Haven
Colony. He is therefore able to approach
the subject without undue bias of ancestral
prejudice, and with the sole desire of vindicating
the truth of impartial history.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>The town of Warwick, R.&nbsp;I., is not
to-day of remarkable interest to the antiquary
or seeker after the venerable
relics of bygone days. It has “come
out into the newness” of our nineteenth
century life. Its streams respond to
the music of the flying shuttle and the
turning wheel with a dash and hurry
almost human in their restlessness. Half
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>a score of flourishing manufacturing villages
lend their potent aid to make it
the sixth town, in population, in the
State having a larger number of inhabitants
to the square mile than any other
in the American Union.</p>

<p class='c010'>The old Colonial and Revolutionary
dwellings were largely, doubtless, of a
humble sort, and have given place to
the more prosperous farm-houses and
pretentious mansions of a generation that
knows not the ways of the fathers. The
busy Pawtuxet and its tributary streams,
partly excused from the drudgery of mill-turning
by the more potent substitutes
of the later day, are pumped away to
quench the thirst of the distant city
whose contentions a quarter of a millenium
ago drove Samuell Gorton<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>his colleagues to seek their homes in
the Shawomet wilderness, there to become
the founders of a State.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet the Warwick of to-day, in its
summer dress, well repays the visitor
who may chance upon its hospitable
soil. All along its beautiful shores arise
pleasant homes and hostelries for the
accommodation of the summer visitor;
while inland, the rolling hills, prosperous
with growing grass and coming harvests,
are not without a quiet and restful
beauty which pleases the eye, and solaces
the mind and heart. In the little
hamlet of Apponaug, close by Coweset
Bay, the brave new Town Hall, one of
the finest in New England, testifies to
the enterprise as well as to the prosperity
of the people. Its newness is in harmonious
touch with the prevalent appearance
of the country around it. There is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>nothing old, apparently, in old Warwick
but the sub-soil and rocks, and here and
there a venerable tree antedating European
occupation, beneath the branches
of which Pomham and Soccononocco,
with their dusky braves, may have sat
and smoked the pipe of peace with the
men of Massachusetts, or taken counsel
as to the best means of circumventing
the united wiles of the head-sachem of
the Narragansetts, Miantonomi, and his
persistent allies, the pale-faced “Gortonoges.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet old Warwick has a history surpassed
in interest by none other of the
New England settlements. Its founder
was a man of intellectual and moral
force, worthy to rank with Roger Williams,
William Bradford, and the other
noble founders of our liberties. He was
a man much misrepresented in his day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>and generation, and but little remembered
and understood even in our own
time, when history is being studied anew
in the light of evolution and a true historical
method, and reconstructed on the
principles of enlightened scholarship and
impartial justice. The later history of
Warwick also has much of interest for
the patriotic American. On its shores
the first blow of our Revolutionary
struggle was struck, in the capture and
destruction of the British schooner Gaspee;
while the heights of Warwick Neck
were then crowned with a fort, long
since dismantled, for the protection of
the settlements around Coweset Bay
from the attacks of the English.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is the Warwick of the seventeenth
century, not that of the eighteenth or
nineteenth, that I would fain call to the
minds of my readers,—the Warwick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>whose inland acres were covered with
the primitive wilderness, where wolves
and Indians were at home,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a> and the
white man was a stranger; the Warwick
which Samuell Gorton sought after being
frozen out of Boston, banished from
Plymouth and Pocasset, and driven by
contentions from Providence and Pawtuxet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yonder, on Conimicut Point, he built
his block-house,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a> and therein defied for
a day and a night the force of Puritans
and savages in equal numbers, aggregating
more than four times his own,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>which Massachusetts sent against him;
finally surrendering to superior battalions
to prevent blood-shed. Farther
south, at the head of Warwick Cove,
a quiet arm of the Narragansett, stood
his humble homestead, where he passed
his declining years in the honorable service
of the Town and Commonwealth
which he helped to found; the land
surrounding which has remained in unbroken
succession in the hands of his
descendants to the present day. Near
by, John Greene, John Wickes, Randall
Holden and the other men, good and
true, who were his colleagues and supporters,
cleared and tilled their allotted
acres, making the wilderness to blossom
as the rose.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes, there are after all some reminders
of these primitive times besides the
sub-soil and the ancient cedar by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Potowomut River; for yonder, at Rocky
Point, the perennial clambake celebrates
in aboriginal fashion and in their native
haunts, the shore-feasts of the Indians.
And down on Potowomut Neck which
Warwick won for her own after long
and litigious struggles, once the favorite
camping ground of the aborigines, you
may still pick up the flint arrow-heads
which they fashioned and left behind
them three centuries ago. You may
paddle up the Pawtuxet, under the
over-arching branches of noble trees,
into quiet reaches of the river, where
the hum of cities and the bustle of civilization
seem remote indeed. And in
the new Town Hall at Apponaug you
may shut out the noises of the day, and
curiously con the ancient records of the
Town;—you may see the very pages on
which these pioneers of a new civilization
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>bore testimony to their humble beginnings,
and told, in part, the story of
the building of a State. I have searched
these records faithfully—here, and in
the library of the Historical Society at
Providence, where other precious manuscripts
are preserved. Some of these
men I have come to know. I have
thought their thoughts after them in
deciphering their writings. I have felt
their throbbing human hearts, laboring
to lay the foundations of a Commonwealth
wherein liberty should be secure
under the protection of law; wherein
the civil power should have no control
over the consciences of men. Something
of this would I lay before the impartial
reader; in justice to these men who so
labored that we might enter into their
labors and reap the ripe fruits thereof;
in justice also to ourselves, that we as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>American citizens may not remain ignorant
of this forgotten chapter in the
noble story of the beginnings of our
National life.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>The story of Samuell Gorton is in a
large part the narrative of the beginnings
of the Commonwealth of Rhode
Island. If I mistake not, it also constitutes
an important and hitherto unrecognized
chapter in the history of the
beginnings of our National life. It is a
story but little known to the average
American citizen. It has been briefly
told by John M. Mackie, in Sparks’
American Biography, and by Gov. Arnold
in his noble volumes of Rhode
Island History. Certain phases of it
have been discussed and amplified in
the interesting monographs of Judge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Staples and Judge Brayton.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a> William
D. Ely has thrown important light upon
some salient points in Gorton’s history,
in reports published in the Proceedings
of the R.&nbsp;I. Historical Society.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Palfrey
has touched it lightly and with
scant justice in his History of New
England, and Fiske, in his Beginnings
of New England, has given it inadequate
treatment.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Other historians have
alluded to Samuell Gorton but to distort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>and misrepresent his actions and
opinions.</p>

<p class='c010'>A mere rehash of the narratives of
Mackie, Arnold, and Brayton would be
unworthy of the attention of this learned
Society. To ignore their conscientious
efforts to do justice to the founder of
Warwick and co-worker with Roger
Williams in the building of a Commonwealth
dedicated to the principle of
Soul Liberty, would, on the other hand,
be unjust and impossible to one who
would rightly sketch the history and
estimate the work of Samuell Gorton.
In the light of all that these just-minded
sons of Rhode Island have written upon
this subject, I have studied it anew and
independently, making use of all available
printed material, and also of valuable
unpublished manuscripts and town
records. I have arrived at certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>conclusions, quite unexpected when I commenced
my investigations, concerning
Gorton’s political and religious philosophy,
which, if correct, will modify previously
received opinions of the man
and his work, and which seem to me
sufficiently vital and important to merit
the attention of all students of American
history. It is the main object of this
paper to set forth the substance of these
conclusions, with some reference to the
documentary evidence on which they are
based. For the instruction of those who
have not made this somewhat obscure
episode in Rhode Island history a special
subject of investigation, some account
of the leading facts of Samuell
Gorton’s career becomes a preliminary
necessity.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Who was Samuell Gorton? What
part did he play in our Colonial history?
These questions let us briefly
answer before we attempt a somewhat
careful study of his religious and political
opinions, about which there has been
so much misunderstanding. Samuell
Gorton was born in the parish of Gorton,
England, a few miles from the
present bustling city of Manchester,
about the year 1592.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a> He came of a
good family, “not entirely unknown,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>says Judge Brayton, “to the heraldry of
England.”<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Here, as Gorton himself
declares, “the fathers of his body had
dwelt for generations.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We know but little about his early
life. Though he did not attend any of
the celebrated schools or universities of
England, his education seems to have
been carefully conducted by private tutors.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
As with many other students of
his day, the Bible was his principal text-book.
He could read it in the original:
he was a master of both Greek and
Hebrew. And he brought to the reading
a vigorous intellect and a more original
and independent judgment than is
commonly applied to theological studies.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Samuell Gorton probably dwelt in
the vicinity of his birthplace until he
was about twenty-five years of age.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
Here he made the acquaintance of a
Separatist Elder, afterwards connected
with the church in Holland, whence
came the Mayflower Pilgrims. His mind
readily assimilated the spirit of the Puritan
revolt against the degenerate formalism
of the times; yet his Puritanism
was without taint of dogmatic narrowness.
He always retained an affection
for the church of his fathers. “I drew
my tenets,” he says, “from the breasts
of my mother, the Church of England.”<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In his early manhood he left Gorton
and went to seek his fortune in the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>English metropolis. In London he engaged
in business, and built for himself
a home. In a certain conveyance signed
during his residence there, he is described
as “Samuell Gorton, clothier,”
and also as “Professor of the misteries
of Christ.” Religion and daily occupation
were never divorced in his consciousness.
He would not make a trade
of the former, nor could he conduct the
latter on a plane inconsistent with those
moral and religious principles which
dominated his life. His business as a
“clothier,” in the phraseology of the
day, was that of a branch of manufacturing—the
finishing of cloths after
weaving. It is doubtful whether he
met with great pecuniary rewards in
his chosen industry. His enemies afterwards
said that he left London in debt,
to avoid imprisonment threatened by his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>creditors. Of this there is no valid evidence;
we may dismiss it on the authority
of his explicit denial.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a> “I left my
native country,” he said, “to enjoy libertie
of conscience in respect to faith
towards God, and for no other end.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Samuell Gorton arrived in Boston in
March, 1636-7.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a> A few months before,
Roger Williams had been banished from
Massachusetts Bay. The Colonial authorities
were now agitated by the
heresies of Anne Hutchinson and John
Wheelwright.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a> They, in turn, were
shortly compelled to seek other dwelling
places to secure opportunity for
free expression of opinion. Evidently,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>the liberty of conscience which Gorton
sought was not to be safely exercised
in Boston. He turned his steps toward
Plymouth, the home of the Separatist
Pilgrims, hoping there to find the goal
of his desires. In Plymouth he hired
for four years a part of the house of
Ralph Smith, formerly the minister of
the Plymouth church, of whom Roger
Williams for a brief time had been the
colleague. Here Gorton first met the
founder of Rhode Island, while on a
visit to his former home. Gorton dwelt
quietly in Plymouth<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a> for a time, with
his family; his wife, Mary,<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a> whom he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>married in London, of whom he says:
“She had been as tenderly brought up
as any man’s wife then in town,” his eldest
son Samuell, a boy of six years when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>he left England, his daughter Mary, and
one or two other children; and one Mrs.
Aldredge, a worthy woman, a widow,
and a servant of Mrs. Gorton’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the latter member of his household
who got him into trouble with the
Plymouth authorities. She committed
the unpardonable sin of smiling in meeting,
on what provocation we know not.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a>
Samuell Gorton defended her before
the magistrates, and advised her not
to appear in person to answer to their
charges, which were based upon no express
allegations of the violation of law.
He vigorously denounced their action as
in opposition to those English precedents
which the customs of many generations
had established for the legal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>protection of persons unjustly accused
of violations of the public peace. For
his alleged contumacy and mutinous behavior
he was fined, held under bonds
to keep the peace, and sentenced to banishment
from the Colony within fourteen
days.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>From Plymouth, he made his way to
Pocasset, the new settlement which the
followers of Anne Hutchinson had begun
on the island of Aquidneck, in
Narragansett Bay, where he arrived,
probably, some time in December, 1638.
The weather was cold and the journey
perilous. His wife, in delicate health,
had an infant at the breast, sick with
measles, which “struck in” under the
exposure, nearly causing its death. At
Pocasset Gorton’s name appears as one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>of four out of fifty-nine freeholders to
which the title of “Mr.” is prefixed,
then an indication of social position and
gentle birth.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a> The government of Pocasset
was at first theocratic, a judge
and five elders constituting its magistrates,
who were bound to execute justice
“according to the laws of God.”
A majority of the community desired a
more democratic form of government;
and Coddington, the judge (afterwards
Governor of the united Colony), with
the elders, and a few other free-holders,
emigrated to the southern end of the
island, where they founded the town of
Newport.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c012'><sup>[20]</sup></a> The remaining free-holders,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>including Samuell Gorton, thus forsaken
by their magistrates, instituted a new
town government, and changed the name
of the settlement to Portsmouth. This
occurred in the spring of 1639. A year
later,<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c012'><sup>[21]</sup></a> the two settlements were united
under one government for the transaction
of affairs of common interest, and the
influence of Coddington and the Newport
magistrates became potent throughout
the island. Gorton and his friends
regarded this coalition as irregular and
illegally constituted. It seems never to
have been sanctioned by a majority of
the free-holders. He appears to have
declined to admit allegiance to it, and to
have permitted his citizenship to lapse,
though still retaining his residence.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not long before he became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>involved with the Portsmouth authorities
in a controversy concerning an alleged
assault of his servant on a woman
who had trespassed on his land in pursuit
of a cow which was also a trespasser.
Gorton again defended his servant, and
denied the legal constitution and jurisdiction
of the court. “They did not
have the choice of the people,” he says,
“but set up for themselves. I know not
any more that was present in their creation
but the clergieman who blessed
them in their inauguration.” His language
was doubtless vigorous and not
wholly parliamentary.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c012'><sup>[22]</sup></a> His keen sense
of justice was outraged by the proceeding,
and his sympathetic nature led him
to severe retorts upon a witness who, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>his opinion, swore falsely, and the magistrates
who were biased in favor of the
prosecution. For his alleged mutinous
behavior he was imprisoned and again
sentenced to banishment. His enemies
say that he was also whipped,<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c012'><sup>[23]</sup></a> but the
Portsmouth records, which are explicit
in reciting the charges and the other penalties,
make no mention of this infliction.
There is evidence, also, that he had many
friends and sympathizers in the settlement.
One of these, John Wickes, for
refusing to testify and denying the legality
and jurisdiction of the court, was
placed in the stocks, and with four others
was banished and disfranchised.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c012'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>The little circle of congenial and independent
souls was growing under persecution.
From Portsmouth they pressed
on to Providence, and though apparently
seeking to avoid rather than to encourage
controversy, they soon became involved
in disputes which had already divided
that settlement into two parties.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c012'><sup>[25]</sup></a> I
shall not enter into the merits of this
controversy, which involved civil and
not religious questions. As in Portsmouth,
Gorton denied the legality of
the self-constituted town government,
and held that justice could not be maintained
until the law was administered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>under authority delegated by the Mother
Country. He was as anxious as any
for liberty, but he would have liberty
protected by law. As an Englishman,
dwelling in a community of Englishmen,
he claimed the protection of those
principles of law and equity, which,
since Magna Charta, had been thrown
around all British citizens. For a time
his vigorous maintenance of this doctrine
brought him in conflict even with Roger
Williams, who, Winthrop says, accused
Gorton of “bewitching and bemadding
poor Providence” with his new and radical
opinions.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c012'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Gorton and his friends purchased land
and commenced a settlement at Popaquinepaug,
or Pawtuxet, within the
jurisdiction of Providence; but certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>of his enemies who owned adjoining
property determined to prevent his
peaceful occupancy. William Arnold
and a few others, to insure his expulsion,
gave in their allegiance to Massachusetts,
and called on the government
of that Colony to remove the intruders.
This, however, is by no means to be
regarded as an official action of the
town of Providence, or as in accordance
with the desires of a majority of her
citizens. It is probable, in fact, that a
majority were sympathizers with Gorton.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c012'><sup>[27]</sup></a>
Nevertheless, not from mere pusillanimity,
but out of a desire for peace,
and a disinclination to embroil Providence
with her more powerful neighbor,
the Gortonists moved on, beyond the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>jurisdiction either of Providence Plantations
or of Massachusetts. Gorton
purchased of Miantonomi, head sachem
of the Narragansetts, and of Pomham
and Soccononocco, under-sachems claiming
local jurisdiction, a tract of land
south of Pawtuxet and west of Narragansett
Bay, then known by the Indian
name of Shawomet.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c012'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c008'><b><span class='xlarge'>IV</span></b> <br /> <br /> <b><span class='large'>TROUBLOUS TIMES AT SHAWOMET</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Not yet, however, were the harassed
Gortonists to be secure in their possessions.
Pomham and Soccononocco were
induced by the enemies of Gorton to
repudiate their signatures to the deed
of Miantonomi. They made their submission
to the government of Massachusetts
and begged its aid to expel the
Gortonists from Shawomet.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c012'><sup>[29]</sup></a> There are
some reasons to believe that this action
was not altogether disconnected from a
possibly more remunerative offer made
them by the Atherton Company, an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>organization which had been formed by
the astute Commissioners of the New
England Confederation, for the purchase
and sale of Indian lands.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c012'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Gorton and his companions were summoned
to Boston to make answer to
Pomham’s claim.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c012'><sup>[31]</sup></a> Denying the jurisdiction
of Massachusetts, in a spicy
correspondence, Gorton refused to obey
the summons. Increase Nowell, Secretary
of the Colony, and the Boston
Elders, discovered no less than twenty-six
instances of blasphemy, “or thereabouts,”
in the terms of Gorton’s epistle.
The Gortonists were warned that if they
continued contumacious they would be
regarded as “fitted for the slaughter,”<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c012'><sup>[32]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>and would be peremptorily dealt with
by force of arms. A company of twenty
white men and an equal number of Indians,
under the command of Captain
Cook, was dispatched to seize them and
bring them to Boston for trial. On
their approach, the Gortonists sent their
women and children across the bay,
retired to their block-house on Conimicut
Point, and awaited the invading force of
the enemy. A company of peace-makers
from Providence<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c012'><sup>[33]</sup></a> demanded a parley,
and proposed the arbitration of the matters
in dispute, to prevent the shedding
of blood. The Gortonists appealed to
the King and were willing to arbitrate,
but the proposition was sternly rejected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>by Gov. Winthrop. “You may do well
to take notice,” he said, “that besides
the title to land between the English
and the Indians there, there are twelve
of the English that have subscribed
their names to horrible and detestable
blasphemies, who are rather to be judged
as blasphemous than they should delude
us by winning time under pretence of
arbitration.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Gortonists stood siege for a day
and a night,<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c012'><sup>[34]</sup></a> and repelled the attempt
of the men of Massachusetts and their
savage allies to set fire to the block-house;
then, to save bloodshed, under
promise that they would be treated as
neighbors, and that their claims would
be submitted to fair judgment in Massachusetts,
they surrendered to superior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>force, and were taken to Boston for
trial.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c012'><sup>[35]</sup></a> They speedily found, however,
that they were regarded as prisoners
and not as “friends and neighbors”
seeking a just and amicable settlement
of civil disagreements. The soldiers,
Gorton says, were ordered to knock
down any one who should utter a word
of insolence, and to run any one through
who might step aside from the line of
advance. When they arrived in Boston,
“the chaplain (of their captors) went
to prayers in the open streets, that the
people might take notice that what they
had done was done in a holy manner,
and in the name of the Lord.”<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c012'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>There was no pretence of a judicial
consideration of their rights as settlers
at Shawomet. They were regarded as
criminal offenders, and were examined
and convicted on the charge of blasphemy.
Gorton was placed on trial for
his life before the General Court and
Convocation of Elders. Four queries,
referring to statements in his vigorous
rejoinder to the summons of the Massachusetts
authorities, were propounded,
and upon his replies the decision of the
Court was to be rendered:<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c012'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>“1. Whether the Fathers, who died
before Christ was born of the Virgin
Mary, were justified and saved only
by the blood which hee shed, and the
death which hee suffered after his incarnation?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“2. Whether the only price of our
redemption were not the death of Christ
on the cross, with the rest of his sufferings
and obediences, in the time of his
life here, after hee was born of the
Virgin Mary?</p>

<p class='c010'>“3. Who was the God whom hee
thinks wee serve?</p>

<p class='c010'>“4. What hee means when hee saith,
wee worship the starre of our God
Remphan, Chion, Moloch?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The latter question may well have
piqued the curiosity of the elders. The
others were evidently framed to secure
conviction. His replies were as wise
and conciliatory as perfect sincerity
would admit, but it was foreordained
that they should be unsatisfactory to
his judges. All but three of the elders
voted for the penalty of death. The
representatives of the people, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>to the honor of Massachusetts, refused
to assent to this verdict<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c012'><sup>[38]</sup></a>. Gorton suffered
imprisonment in Charlestown, with
a ball and chain attached to his ankle;
the other accused persons were incarcerated
in irons in other towns of the
Colony. The next General Court, some
months later, set them at liberty,<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c012'><sup>[39]</sup></a> but
banished them from all places within
the jurisdiction of Massachusetts—the
intention being to include the disputed
territory at Shawomet, which Massachusetts
claimed under the deed of
Pomham.</p>

<p class='c010'>As they went forth from their prison
houses, the Gortonists recited their
wrongs in the public streets in Boston
and elsewhere to crowds of willing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>listeners and ready sympathizers. Palfrey
admits that a majority of the people in
Massachusetts were to be counted in
this category.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c012'><sup>[40]</sup></a> The sufferings of these
martyrs were the seeds of a new Commonwealth,
from which the persecuting
spirit was at last eliminated. The Indians,
also, even in the vicinity of Boston,
received them gladly. Cutshamekin, the
chief sachem of the neighborhood, to
whose wigwam the liberated men accidentally
strayed, when asked by Gorton
whether Capt. Cook, the commander of
their captors, was a good captain, replied,
“I can not tell; but the Indians
regard those as good captains when a
few stand out against many.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Their chief grievance during imprisonment
seems to have been that they were
compelled to attend the Sunday services
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>in the churches, and be “preached at” by
the Puritan ministers. “They brought
us forth unto their congregations to hear
their ministers,” says Gorton, with a
grim humor, illuminated by some knowledge
of natural history, “which was
meat to be digested, but only by the
hearte or stomacke of an ostrich.”<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c012'><sup>[41]</sup></a>
Pastor Ward, of Ipswich, who visited
one of them—Richard Carder, an old
neighbor of his in England—while in
prison, and urged him to recant his heresies,
said by way of encouragement, “it
shall be no disparagement to you, for
here is our revered elder, Mr. Cotton,
who ordinarily preacheth that publickely
one yeare, that the next yeare hee publickely
repents of, and shows him selfe
to bee very sorrowful to the congregation.”<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c012'><sup>[42]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>As his sly dig at Mr. Cotton
would indicate, Pastor Ward was entirely
sound in his own theology. This
appears also in his “Simple Cobbler of
Agawam,” where, with a spicy use of
capitals, and vigorous if not elegant
English, he denounces the brains of
those who advocate “Libertie of Conscience
in matters of Religion,” as “parboiled
in impious ignorance.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>After his release, in the spring of
1643-44, Gorton returned through Shawomet,
where he was forbidden to linger,
to Portsmouth, where he and his
friends were received with open arms,
and where he was shortly elected to a
magistracy on the very scene of his
former persecutions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus far the Atherton Company appeared
to have made substantial progress
in its efforts to obtain possession of
the Shawomet lands, and Massachusetts
seemed likely to succeed in throwing a
girdle of unfriendly possessions around
the Providence Plantations, thereby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>separating them from the Aquidneck settlements,
and securing a permanent control
over Narragansett Bay. By the submission
of Arnold and the malcontents of
Providence, they had obtained a show
of authority over the Pawtuxet or Popaquinepaug
territory. Winthrop had
secured possession of Prudence Island
in Narragansett Bay by purchasing the
half originally owned by Roger Williams,<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c012'><sup>[43]</sup></a>
and now with a marvellous inconsistency,
held the whole by a title
derived solely from Miantonomi, the
chief sachem of the Narragansetts. If
he could maintain his denial of the
rights of Gorton to the Shawomet lands
claimed by even a stronger title, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>would succeed in his efforts to divide
the Narragansett settlements and establish
the claims of Massachusetts. With
this end in view, the Massachusetts
authorities built a block-house for Pomham
on Warwick Neck, and temporarily
succeeded in excluding the Gortonists
from their Shawomet possessions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gorton, however, was not idle. He
had no thought of permanently relinquishing
the claim for which he had
contended so bravely, and to which he
was justly entitled. Within forty days
of his release from prison, by a masterly
piece of strategy and statesmanship, he
inaugurated measures which completely
check-mated his opponents, and gave
him a permanent advantage in the contest
for supremacy. On the 19th of
April, 1644, by the earnest advice and
solicitation of Gorton, the Narragansett
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Indians, in solemn conclave, constituted
their “trusty and well-beloved friends,”
Samuell Gorton, John Wickes, Randall
Holden and John Warner, commissioners
to convey their submission to the
British Government. The deed of submission,
signed by the sachems Pessicus,
Conanicus, Mixan, Awoshosse and Tomanick,
is preserved in the Historical
Cabinet at Providence. The tragical
death of the head sachem, Miantonomi,
in the previous September, at the hands
of his bitter enemies, the Mohegans,
with the consent of the Boston elders—a
story so well told by Dr. Fiske in his
“Beginnings of New England” that I
need not repeat it here,—as well as the
revolt of Pomham and Soccononocco,
were powerful arguments with the Narragansetts
in favor of seeking the protection
of the British Government; while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the return of Gorton and his companions,
unscathed, from the prisons of
Massachusetts, convinced the Narragansetts
that the power of the Mother
Country was on their side, and had
stood between them and their oppressors.</p>

<p class='c010'>In August, 1645, the Commissioners
of the United Colonies, in session in
Boston, declared war against the Narragansetts,
and dispatched a military force
to Rhode Island; at the same time warning
the General Assembly of Providence
Plantations, then in session at Newport,
that if they adhered to their declared
determination of maintaining a position
of neutrality they would be regarded
as enemies. They also forbade them
to exercise the powers of government
under the charter obtained by Roger
Williams.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>In response to this threatening action
of “the Massachusetts,” Gorton, Greene
and Holden set sail, after vexatious
delays, under authority of Providence
Plantations, from the Dutch settlement
at Manhattan for Holland, whence, after
more delay, they obtained transportation
to England. The exact time of their
arrival at London is unknown, but they
had been preceded by the agents of
Massachusetts, and were compelled to
meet the charges already formulated by
their enemies. Their answer, prepared
by Gorton in “Simplicities Defence,”
was published in London on the 3d of
August, 1646. Soon after,<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c012'><sup>[44]</sup></a> a patent
was issued to Gorton and his colleagues
which granted the Shawomet lands to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>them and their successors forever, and
guaranteed them protection against all
other claimants. In the troublous times
between the King and Parliament the
formal submission of the Narragansetts
which Gorton had conveyed to England,
could not be delivered to King Charles
in person, and Gorton accordingly caused
it to be published in London. By this
admirable piece of strategy and statesmanship
he forever blocked the movements
of Massachusetts Bay for the
control of the Narragansett country.
Gorton received safe-conduct from the
Earl of Warwick, on his return, through
the domains of the enemy.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c012'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Roger Williams, who had finally accepted
Gorton’s theory of the true
foundations of the new government,
had preceded him to England, and on
the 14th of March, 1643-44, had obtained
a charter for the Colony which
united the northern and southern towns
in one Commonwealth. Owing to the
opposition of the Coddington faction,
government was not completely organized
under this charter until May, 1647.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c012'><sup>[46]</sup></a>
In the same year, town government was
organized at Shawomet, the Town, in
honor of its patron, receiving the name
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>of Warwick. Some further futile attempts
were made by Massachusetts to
enforce her claims, but the Gortonists
thereafter retained possession, which
gave them “nine points of the law,”
and finally complete victory. Pomham,
for whom Massachusetts had erected a
block-house on Warwick Neck, lingered
in the neighborhood a few years, but at
last saw that the “Gortonoges” had
triumphed in their long contest with
the “Wattaconoges,”<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c012'><sup>[47]</sup></a> and in 1665 sold
out his dishonored claim for £30 in
peage,<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c012'><sup>[48]</sup></a> paid him by Gorton and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>associates. The new Commonwealth
was fairly launched upon the sea of
History; the town of Warwick and its
founder were to play an honorable part
in the story of its beginnings.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'><b><span class='xlarge'>VI</span></b> <br /> <br /> <b><span class='large'>SAMUELL GORTON’S LATER CAREER</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>During the succeeding quarter of a
century Samuell Gorton was active and
influential in shaping the destinies of
the growing State. He occupied the
highest places of honor and responsibility
at the gift of his fellow-citizens,
and was habitually called into service
when sound judgment, prompt and
courageous action, and literary ability
were requisite. He represented Portsmouth
in the Assembly at Newport in
1645. He was chosen one of the Commissioners
of the town of Warwick to
the General Assembly on his return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>from England, and served therein a
greater part of the time for the next
two or three decades. He was placed
on the most important committees, and
his pen was frequently called into requisition
to prepare State papers, and letters
to the magistrates of other Colonies, and
to the representatives of the new Commonwealth
in England. Though absent
in the Mother Country during the first
year of Colonial Government under the
charter of 1643-44, his political views
were embodied in the remarkable Code
of 1647, passed by the first General
Assembly of the United Colony, one of
the earliest compilations of law in American
history. In the construction of this
Code, care was taken to avoid the errors
of which Gorton had complained, in the
judicial procedure of the other Colonies,
by making each section conform to existing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>English law,<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c012'><sup>[49]</sup></a> reference to the corresponding
English statute being placed
at the end thereof.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c012'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The provision respecting witchcraft is
especially noteworthy as indicating a
prevailing scepticism in Rhode Island at
a time when Massachusetts was under
the spell of the delusion, soon to break
forth in an appalling epidemic of persecution.
The object of its introduction
is evidently the set purpose of conforming
to English precedents rather than a
conviction of the legislators that the
statute was demanded by any real public
necessity. The section reads:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“Witchcraft is forbidden by this present
Assembly to be used in this Colonie;
and the Penaltie <i>imposed by the authoritie
that wee are subjected to, is felonie of
death</i>.—I Jac. 12.”<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c012'><sup>[51]</sup></a> The Code of 1647
also forbade imprisonment for debt, and
is otherwise in advance of most contemporary
legislation. The temper of the
Colony on the subject of witchcraft is
still further evidenced in the testimony
of their opponents,<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c012'><sup>[52]</sup></a> who complained in
an anonymous letter addressed to the
agent of Massachusetts in England a few
years later, that the new government was
ignoring the English law. This epistle
especially stigmatized “some of them at
Shawomet that cryeth out much against
them that putteth people to death for
witches, for they say there be no other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>witches upon earth, nor devils, but your
own pasters and ministers, such as they
are.”<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c012'><sup>[53]</sup></a> There was apparently never a
prosecution in Rhode Island under the
statute against witchcraft.</p>

<p class='c010'>Samuell Gorton’s literary style is clearly
evident in the remarkable statute
against negro slavery, passed by the
General Assembly in 1652—the first
legislative edict of emancipation ever
adopted in America. This statute was
passed during the Coddington secession
of 1651-54, and consequently voices officially
only the sentiment of Providence
and Warwick. Roger Williams was in
England at the time of its passage, and
there can be little doubt that Samuell
Gorton was its author and principal
advocate. Though it subsequently became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>a dead letter, it was apparently
never repealed, and merits perpetuation
in the annals of the anti-slavery conflict.
It reads as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whereas there is a common course
practised amongst English men to buy
negers, to the end that they may have
them for service or slaves forever; for
the preventinge of such practices among
us, let it bee ordered, that no blacke
mankinde or white, being forced by
covenant bond or otherwise, to serve
any man or his assigns longer than ten
yeares, or untill they come to bee twentie
four yeares of age if they bee taken
in under fourteen, from the time of their
cominge within the liberties of this Collonie.
And at the end or terme of ten
yeares to sett them free as the manner is
with the English servants. And that
man that will not let them goe free, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>shall sell them away elsewhere to that
end that they may bee enslaved to others
for a long time, hee or they shall forfeit
to the Colonie forty pounds.”<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c012'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Samuell Gorton was elected General
Assistant, a position corresponding with
that of Lieutenant Governor, in 1649,
and in 1651, during the Coddington
secession, he was chosen to the highest
position at the gift of the Commonwealth—he
became its President. During
the following year, he was Moderator
or Speaker of the General Assembly,
and he several times subsequently served
as General Assistant. He was also active
in the affairs of the Town of Warwick,
being for many years a member of
the Town Council, and holding other
positions of honor and responsibility.
“After the venerable founder of Providence,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>says his biographer,<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c012'><sup>[55]</sup></a> “no man
was more instrumental in establishing
the foundations of equal civil rights and
‘soul liberty’ in Rhode Island than Samuell
Gorton.” He was especially active in
assuring the protection of the Colony for
the persecuted Quakers.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c012'><sup>[56]</sup></a> He sent them
messages of sympathy when they were in
prison in Massachusetts, and was authorized
by the General Assembly to reply
to the epistles of the Massachusetts authorities
protesting against their finding
an asylum in Rhode Island. When Massachusetts
appealed to England, Samuell
Gorton was designated to prepare a letter
on behalf of the Rhode Island Government
to John Clarke, the representative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>of the Colony in the Mother Country,
to be presented to the Lord Protector,
Oliver Cromwell. He requests Clarke
“to plead our case in such sorte as wee
may not bee compelled to exercise any
civill power over men’s consciences, so
long as humane orders in poynt of civility
are not corrupted and voyalated,
which our neighbors aboute us doe frequently
practise, whereof many of us
have large experience, and doe judge it
to bee no less than a poynt of absolute
crueltie.”<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c012'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>On the collapse of the Puritan Commonwealth
in England, Samuell Gorton
was appointed on a Committee to select
agents of the Colony in England, and
prepare an address to his Majesty, King
Charles the Second.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c012'><sup>[58]</sup></a> As a result of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>this action, and of the wise intercession
of John Clarke, then representing the
Colony in England, the Charter of 1663
was secured, in which Samuell Gorton
was named as one of the incorporators
of the new Commonwealth. In 1663
he was also appointed by the Town
Council “overseer” of the will of John
Smith, Deputy from Warwick, under the
curious provision by which the towns in
Rhode Island made wills for persons
dying intestate, dividing their property
according to the communal sense of justice.
In 1666, after the purchase of
Pomham’s claim, Mr. Gorton was assigned
ten shares in Warwick Neck,
and was still further recognized in
another division in the following year.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c012'><sup>[59]</sup></a>
In 1675, during the storm and stress of
King Philip’s war, tradition says that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>Samuell Gorton’s life was saved by
friendly Indians, who rowed him across
the Bay to a place of safety. He was
always on amicable terms with the
aborigines, treating them justly, teaching
and exhorting in their settlements,
and wisely advising them in various
emergencies.</p>

<p class='c010'>Warwick suffered severely in the contest
with King Philip, which would
doubtless have been prevented had the
policy of Roger Williams and Samuell
Gorton in dealing with the Indians been
generally adopted. The town was depopulated,
the houses and barns were
burned, and the cattle driven into the
wilderness. A pitched battle was fought
in an open cedar swamp in Warwick
between the Indians under Canonchet
and a company of men from Plymouth.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c012'><sup>[60]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Many of the colonists took refuge on
Aquidneck, the waters around which
were patrolled night and day by a flotilla
of four boats, filled with armed men.</p>

<p class='c010'>Judge Staples tells us that John
Wickes, the friend and colleague of
Samuell Gorton, trusting too implicitly
to the friendship of the savages, remained
and was slain; his head being set upon
a pole as a warning to others. In this,
he must be mistaken, however, since the
will of John Wickes, dated the second
day of March, 1688, and signed by himself,
though written and witnessed by
Samuell Gorton, the younger, may be
seen to-day in the library of the
Historical Society in Providence. This
interesting document also contains the
signatures of two others of the founders,
of Warwick,—Randall Holden, the justice
before whom it was proved, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>John Greene, who signs in behalf of
himself and the other members of the
Town Council.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the fourth day of June, 1677,
probably the year of his death, Samuell
Gorton, Senior, was elected “to the
Towne Counsell for the ensuing yeare,”
as the ancient records tell us, and his
son, Capt. Samuell Gorton, was at the
same time chosen Town Treasurer. On
the 20th of July the father signed a
deed of lands owned by him in the Narragansett
Country to his sons, his six
daughters and their husbands also being
remembered in the disposition of this
property; and on the 27th of November
of the same year, by another deed, he divided
his entire remaining estate among
his three sons, Samuell, John and Benjamin.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c012'><sup>[61]</sup></a>
To the former, who was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>evidently a man after his own heart, and
who had aided in supporting the family,
he gave his homestead at Old Warwick,
his household furniture, library and most
precious literary possessions. He also
committed to him the care of his mother
during her widow-hood, providing that
she should be maintained with convenient
housing and necessaries, and that
means should be furnished for her “recreation
in case she desires to visit her
friends.”<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c012'><sup>[62]</sup></a> His lands at Coweset, beyond
the boundaries of the Shawomet
grant, he gave in equal possession, undivided,
to his three sons. The document
attesting the final division of these lands
by the surviving sons, Samuell and John,
bears date on the town records, Dec. 4,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>1699, being executed, as it says, “according
to the expressed wish of our Ancient
and Honored ffather, Mr. Samuell Gorton,
one of the first settlers of this Plantation
of Warwick in New England.”
His son Benjamin, then deceased, had
been one of the founders of the new
town of East Greenwich, the organization
of which dates from the year of
the original bequest.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'><b><span class='xlarge'>VII</span></b> <br /> <br /> <b><span class='large'>SAMUELL GORTON’S POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The enemies of Samuell Gorton
charged that he was a practical anarchist—a
denier of all governmental
authority. As the indictment of the
Massachusetts magistrates reads: “Upon
much examination &amp; serious consideration
of yo<sup>r</sup> writings, &amp; with yo<sup>r</sup> answers
about them, wee doe charge yo<sup>u</sup> to bee a
blasphemous enemy of the true religion
of o<sup>r</sup> Lord Jesus Christ and his holy
ordinances, &amp; also of all civil authority
among the people of God, perticulerly
in this iurisdiction.”<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c012'><sup>[63]</sup></a> To the impartial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>student of this history, his entire career
offers a sufficient answer to this accusation.
Even Gov. Arnold, his lineal descendant
and strenuous defender in
many things, who regarded him as “one
of the most remarkable men who ever
lived,”<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c012'><sup>[64]</sup></a> falls into the error of stating
that “he denied the right of a people to
self-government.”<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c012'><sup>[65]</sup></a> What Samuell Gorton
really denied was the dogma of
“squatter sovereignty,” that false conception
of popular government which
holds that a majority of the actual settlers
in any given locality have a right
to legislate and govern as they please,
without regard for the claims of the
minority, the law of civilized communities,
or the principles of equity and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>justice. Had he lived a generation ago
he would have stood with Lincoln and
Sumner and Garrison in denouncing this
mischievous dogma. His doctrine was
identical with that of the defenders of
the Union against the alleged right of
secession. In his own day he held, simply,
that no Englishman expatriated
himself by becoming a colonist in the
possessions of the Mother Country; that
he did not by emigration to America
forfeit the rights of an Englishman, or
the protection guaranteed by the long
line of statutes, decisions and precedents,
beginning with Magna Charta,
which had become the heritage of Englishmen
everywhere.</p>

<p class='c010'>Samuell Gorton held that as subjects
of Great Britain the Colonial governments
should conform in their legislation
and judicial action to the principles of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>English common and statute law.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c012'><sup>[66]</sup></a> If
chartered, they were bound to do this
by the terms of their charters. If not
chartered, each individual had the right
to claim the protection of English law,
and any denial thereof was a usurpation
of authority. This was the head and
front of his alleged anarchism. It was
not anarchism, but the conviction that
liberty is a chimera save under the protection
of the sacred majesty of law.
This is good English and American doctrine
to-day. It is distinctively Rhode
Island doctrine. No one two hundred
and fifty years ago saw it more clearly
than Samuell Gorton. His political
vision was more lucid and prescient
than that of Roger Williams, though
the latter soon saw the force of Gorton’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>position, and adhered to it the rest of
his life. Had Gorton lived until the
time of Andros and James the Second
he would have beheld the Colonies
fighting for their charters as the very
foundation of their liberties. His position
was already justified.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c012'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In defence of “soul liberty” and the
limitation of the functions of government
solely to civil affairs, Gorton and
Williams stood side by side from the
beginning. Authority, he says, cannot
safely be entrusted to magistrates “if
their place and office bee not bounded
within the compass of civill things.”
He argues clearly and logically in the
introduction to his “Incorruptible Key,
Composed of the CX Psalme,” that if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>magistrates are permitted to extend their
authority to things spiritual they are
consistently bound to enforce their own
convictions of religious duty, and to
persecute all who dissent therefrom.
The only safety is in forbidding them
“to intermeddle between God and the
consciences of men. * * In that way
only is the preservation and honour of
all States, in their several ways of rule
and government.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This theory, for the first time in the
world’s history, was clearly proclaimed,
embodied in constitutional law, and practically
tested, in the Commonwealth
founded by Roger Williams and Samuell
Gorton. The Puritan theocracy and
the doctrine of “soul liberty” for a time
maintained a competitive existence, side
by side in the New England Colonies.
The latter began in relative weakness—almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>in anarchy—but it survived,
and ultimately obtained recognition in
our Federal Constitution. The former
failed, and was practically discarded
in less than two generations. Connecticut,
an offshoot from Massachusetts
Puritanism, under the leadership of
Hooker reversed the Massachusetts theory
that citizenship should be conditioned
on church membership, and absorbed
the theocratic Colony of New
Haven. Rhode Island gained, in numbers
and in internal cohesion, and
Massachusetts lost, with every attack
which she made on heresy. The idea
that intolerance and persecution were
necessary to insure the survival of the
community—to prevent its disintegration—broached
by apologetic writers,
is therefore disproven by the palpable
facts of history. Disintegration and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>secession were ever the products of intolerance.
The story of the Saracens,
in Spain, the Huguenots in France and
the Puritans in England, was repeated in
Massachusetts. Internal schisms were
promoted rather than prevented by the
policy of persecution.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the end, local public opinion was a
powerful aid to the compulsion of the
Mother Country in compelling the cessation
of persecution. The policy of
intolerance failed on its own chosen
ground, and Massachusetts became a
powerful and united State only when
she followed the example of her despised
Little Sister and became a Commonwealth
of Ideas as well as a Commonwealth
of Goods.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'><b><span class='xlarge'>VIII</span></b> <br /> <br /> <b><span class='large'>SAMUELL GORTON’S RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Samuell Gorton was a man of a profoundly
religious nature. His views,
have been little studied, and have been
greatly misunderstood, both by his contemporaries
and the historians of later
generations. John Fiske dismisses him
with a sentence, in his admirable School
History of the United States, as “a man
of queer ideas.” The more extended
reference of this fair-minded historian,
in his “Beginnings of New England,”
hardly does justice either to Gorton’s
political sagacity, or to the remarkable
character of his religious opinions.
Charles Francis Adams, in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>monograph on “Massachusetts, its Historians
and its History,” alludes to Samuell Gorton
as a “crude and half-crazy thinker.”</p>

<p class='c010'>His contemporaries in Massachusetts
assailed him with a choice collection of
opprobrious epithets in the place of
arguments: he was an “arch-heretic,” a
“beast,” a “miscreant,” a “proud and
pestilent seducer,” a “most prodigious
minter of exorbitant novelties.”<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c012'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Edward Rawson, some time Secretary
of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay,
and the ancestor of my own children,—a
man capable of making vigorous use of
the sturdy Anglo-Saxon of the period,
albeit not always grammatically, denounces
him as “a man whose spirit
was stark drunk with blasphemies and
insolences, a corrupter of the truth, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>disturber of the peace wherever he
comes;” and his contemporary, Nathaniel
Morton, with whom he conducted an
animated correspondence, says he “was
deeply leavened with blasphemous and
familistical opinions.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In so far as his religious views have
received attention in recent years, they
have been mainly studied in their incomplete
and incidental expression in
some of his published works, “Simplicities
Defence Against Seven-Headed Policie,”
and “The Incorruptible Key to
the CX Psalme,” the main object of
which was political and polemical rather
than expository of his system of thought.
The involved style and quaint and
mystical phraseology have repelled the
modern student, and prevented a clear
understanding of his theological doctrines.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>By far the best and most complete
exposition of Samuell Gorton’s religious
convictions is to be found in a
remarkable manuscript in his own
hand-writing which has never been
published, but which is preserved in
the library of the Rhode Island Historical
Society in Providence. I am
indebted to the Hon. Amos Perry, the
courteous Librarian of the Society, for
the opportunity to make a careful study
of this paper as well as of other documents
relating to Samuell Gorton’s life
and work. The manuscript to which I
refer is a running commentary on the
Lord’s Prayer. Merely as a literary
curiosity it merits the attention of the
studious and curious. It is in the clear,
careful, accurate hand-writing of the
scholar rather than of one accustomed to
manual industry. The lines are closely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>written, the characters are minute, and
almost as accurate as copper-plate impressions.
The manuscript averages over
two thousand words to a page about the
size of our modern legal cap. The character
of the writing makes it exceedingly
trying to the eyes. The orthography,
though in some respects archaic, is more
regular and consistent than in most
American documents of our Revolutionary
era. I have examined many papers
of contemporary and more recent dates,
but with the exception of those left by
his eldest son, Capt. Samuell Gorton,
who was evidently instructed by his
father, and whose hand-writing resembles
his so closely as to be distinguishable
from it with difficulty,
I have never seen any so clear, systematic,
and scholarly in appearance. The
literary form, however, is less admirable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>than the clerical execution. The style
is involved, the sentences are long, and
the punctuation, though systematic, is
peculiar. Free use is made of the comma,
semi-colon and parenthesis, but periods
are most economically distributed, being
used literally to indicate a “full stop.”
Sentences usually end with a semi-colon,
the ensuing clause beginning with a
capital. The interrogation point was
apparently unknown.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the reader has searched diligently
beneath the quaint and involved
phraseology, bristling with scriptural
references and illustrations, and come
into sympathetic contact with the living
thought of the writer, the surprising
thing which is discovered is the remarkable
modernness of many of Samuell
Gorton’s ideas. It goes without saying
that he was not “orthodox” according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>to the conventional standards of his
time, nor yet, perhaps, of our own; but
we everywhere touch the personality
of a vigorous and independent thinker,
who in many directions foreshadowed
the views of the advanced thinkers of
a later day.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some of his enemies denounced Samuell
Gorton as an atheist. He was as
remote as possible from atheistic leanings.
He was not even affiliated with
the deism of his own and the succeeding
century. His theology was profoundly
Christian. It was as Christocentric as
that of Swedenborg, with which it has
sometimes been compared. Like Swedenborg,
he regarded the Infinite and
Absolute as <i>per se</i> unknowable. Here
both Gorton and Swedenborg are in
touch with the modern philosophical
agnostic. For both, however, Christianity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>solved the agnostic problem. In
Christ they found a perfect expression
of the divine nature, and the only rational
object of worship.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c012'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>With regard to the nature of Christ,
however, Gorton and Swedenborg were
widely separated. Swedenborg’s theology
is boldly anthropomorphic; Gorton’s
was monistic and impersonal. “The
word ‘person’,” he says, “is only borrowed
from men and translated to God.
* * That doctrine which ties the
death of Christ to one perticuler man
in one time and age of the world, as
being the scope and intent of God’s will
concerninge the death of his son in the
salvation of the world, that doctrine
falsifies the death of Jesus Christ, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>sets men upon the law of workes in the
ground and matter of their salvation,
by which law no man is justified.”<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c012'><sup>[70]</sup></a>
Here, too, is another radical distinction
between his doctrine and that of Swedenborg.
The latter turns his most
powerful batteries upon Paul’s doctrine
of “justification by faith,” while Gorton
stands with Luther in its defence.</p>

<p class='c010'>The “law of works” by which Gorton
says no man is justified, he rightly interprets
as the conception of salvation
through ceremonial observances; not
merely the ritual of Pharisaic Judaism
denounced by the Master, but the ritual
and ordinances as well of his own day
and generation. Here he stands with
the Friends, as he also did in his opposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>to a “hireling ministry.” Worship,
he taught, is natural to man. Every
man is called to seek communion with
the divine in Christ directly, and not
through priestly mediations. “Prophesie,
prayer, and interpretation of the
word of God are one,” he says: “where
one is there is the other; they are co-insident
and co-aparant.” All men are
naturally moved to prayer; all men,
therefore, may rightfully exhort and
interpret. To the conventional interpretations
of churches, universities and
schools, he preferred “the universitie of
humane reason, and reading of the great
volume of visible creation.” Mr. Gorton
defined prayer as “nothing else but
the true breath and spirit of the eternall
word, according to God’s intent taken
and rained into the soule, concocted and
digested in the cauldron of man’s necessities,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>breathing out it selfe unto the
fountaine and originall of all suply.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The spirit of prophecy and inspiration,
he taught, is as immediately with
man now as in any period of the past.
The tenor of his teaching in this particular
is strikingly like that of the modern
transcendentalist. With Emerson, he
would have asked, “Why may not we,
too, seek an original relation with the
Universe?” In the spirit of transcendentalism,
too, he opposed all sectarianism.
He would not be the founder of
a sect. He left no organized body of
disciples.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c012'><sup>[71]</sup></a> The sectarian contests of the
day, even the disputes between Protestants
and Catholics, he deemed of small
account because they were so largely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>about rites and ceremonies, matters
which he deemed non-essential. “These
things men contend aboute and make
great stirre in the world, whilst the
life and spirit of the gospel lies buried
under humane ordinances and carnall
traditions.” True worship, he declares,
is as well exemplified in the offering of
lambs and bullocks “according to the
letter of scripture formerly manifested,
* * as in bread, wine, wafers, &amp;c., or
in Bishop, paster, teacher, elder, deacon,
&amp;c., for these things in the outward
forme simply considered are carnall and
momentary, but the words of Christ,
they are spirit and they are life.”</p>

<p class='c010'>While he agreed with the Friends as
to outward ordinances, Samuell Gorton
strongly contested some of their other
teachings, especially the doctrine of the
“inner light,” which he saw might be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>interpreted as a particular revelation of
infallible truth to the individual.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c012'><sup>[72]</sup></a> Such
an assumption, he claimed, is mischievous
and erroneous. All revelations must
appeal for examination, recognition and
interpretation to the natural human reason,
which is a common possession of
all men. Mr. Gorton combined with a
remarkably equable balance, the methods
of the mystic and the rationalist.
His mysticism rejected all claims of infallibility,
which logically tend to the
persecution of dissidents. Yet, while
he carried this idea so far that he would
dispense with all paid ministries, he
recognized more fully than most Protestants
of his day the necessity of sound
learning and thorough acquaintance with
the Scriptures in their original tongues,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>to assure their correct and valid interpretation.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c012'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Though in the highest degree Christocentric,
Samuell Gorton’s theology was
not in harmony with the prevailing
Trinitarianism of his day. The doctrine
“received from the schoole men of the
church of Roome, that hold and teach a
trinitie of persons in one simple and
divine essence, without having respect
for the humane nature of Christ,” he
characterizes as “a most dangerous and
pernicious doctrine.” It is, he says,
“most derogatory to the glory of the
son; for in that time he is deprived of
the glory of a saviour; for without
man’s nature hee is not Jesus; hee is no
saviour but in man; hee is not the
anointed nor the redeemer but in man’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>nature; and if wee deprive him of that
glory for a time it is to late to give it
to him afterwards, because hee ever remains
one and the same.” The scriptural
references to the Father, Son and
Holy Spirit he interprets as recognitions
of “spirituall distinctions in the nature
of Christ.” They are not separate persons
of a god-head, but distinctions of
the divine activity, having a unity “not
found elsewhere, but only in Christ.”<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c012'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>With Channing, Samuell Gorton also
taught the essential divinity of human
nature—the equal nearness of the divine
spirit to the sinner and to the saint.
He recognizes a divine spark in every
human soul, and to this he made his
appeal.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c012'><sup>[75]</sup></a> He also, however, accepted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>the eternal antagonism of good and evil
as an unquestionable fact both in scriptural
teaching and in human experience.
The tendency of the one is to eternal
life; of the other to eternal death. He
therefore taught a conditional immortality,
wholly dependent upon the character
of the individual. “Neither can
any salvation hold proportion with the
son of God,” he says, “but freedome
from sin.” This saved him from the
errors of Antinomianism.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c012'><sup>[76]</sup></a> The doctrine
of imputed sin and imputed righteousness
he denounces as unworthy of the
divine character. “God was in Christ
reconciling men unto him selfe, not imputing
their sins.” Nor is this work of
reconciliation limited to any historical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>period. “God is eternally a creator,
eternally a redeemer, eternally a conservator
of peace.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The substance of his teaching is that
righteousness <i>is</i> life eternal; sin <i>is</i> eternal
death. This is no arbitrary penalty
inflicted at the close of man’s earthly
career, or on some future day of judgment;
it is the intrinsic and natural
result of evil action. The popular distinction
between a man and his actions
is delusive and unreal. He could not
hate the sin and love the sinner. The
actions <i>are</i> the man. If the actions are
predominantly evil there is nothing left
to save. The divine work of regeneration
is at one and the same time the salvation
of the good and the destruction
of the evil. Both results are effected
by one and the same natural operation
of the divine power. “The righteousness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>of God is of eternal worth and
duration; But the one and the other
[course of life] being wrought into a
change at one and the same time, thence
comes the capacity of an eternall life,
and of an eternall destruction.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Gorton distinguishes four distinct
stages in the historical development of
religious ideas: the family, the national,
the apostolic, and the spiritual or universal.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c012'><sup>[77]</sup></a>
Considering the period in which
he wrote, and the fact that the Bible
seems to have been almost his only text-book,
his conclusions are remarkably
consistent with those of modern students
of sociology and comparative religion.</p>

<p class='c010'>The temptation is great to continue
this line of exposition and quotation,
but I must bring it to a close with one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>or two additional passages further illustrative
of the ethical quality of his
thought. All virtue, he taught, even
the goodness of God, consists wholly in
the service of others. “The goodnesse
of God’s nature is such,” he says, “that
it cannot subsiste or bee without communicating
it selfe with another, otherwise
his goodnesse should bee uselesse,
which can not bee admitted for one
moment of time, for there is an impossibility
thereof; The naturall temporary
or tipicall goodnesse of any creature is
uselesse unlesse it bee communicated
with another; God never made any
creature in heaven or in earth simply
for it selfe, but for the use of another;
how infinitely more is this true of God,
who hath made him selfe in Christ to
bee the goodnesse of the world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Heaven, Samuell Gorton taught, is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>to be sought in a future life or in some
distant part of the universe. The soul
is even <i>now</i> in eternity. Heaven is a
condition of the soul. It may exist
here and now. “Such doctrine,” he
says, “as sets forth a time to come, of
more worth and glory than either is,
or hath been, keeps the manna for tomorrow,
to the breeding of worms in it.”
With Theodore Parker, he taught that
the divine nature is both masculine and
feminine;<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c012'><sup>[78]</sup></a> and in one of the most striking
and eloquent passages in his Commentary
on the Lord’s Prayer he argues
for the equal recognition of woman in
the Church, and as a teacher of religion.</p>

<p class='c010'>In philosophy, Samuell Gorton was an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>original thinker rather than a student of
past systems. In theology, he was far
in advance of the prevailing thought of
his time. Only a few of the minor sects
of our own day have yet approximated
to his views as to the equal position of
woman in the pulpit and the church;
only an occasional strong and independent
mind has reached his conception of
religion as a birthright of the individual
soul, to which belongs the unalienable
privilege of investigation and interpretation,
free from priestly mediation and
sectarian bias.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'><b><span class='xlarge'>IX</span></b> <br /> <br /> <b><span class='large'>CONCLUSION</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In conclusion, what shall we say were
the peculiar and distinctive contributions
of Samuell Gorton to the Commonwealth
which he helped to found,
and the life of our later day? I answer,
first, to him more than to any
other we are indebted for the recognition
and establishment of the principle that
English law and the rights of English
citizenship are coextensive with English
supremacy; and that to secure these
rights in the Colonies, together with
the privileges of local administration, a
charter from the Home Government was
necessary. This principle had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>ignored or denied by Roger Williams,<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c012'><sup>[79]</sup></a>
and violated by the governments of Plymouth
and Massachusetts Bay. Samuell
Gorton affirmed it in season and out of
season; in its defence suffered imprisonment
and stripes, and did not rest until
by the aid of Roger Williams at last
convinced by his insistency and by the
stern logic of events, it was accepted
by the Commonwealth, affirmed in its
Charter, and embodied in its legislation.</p>

<p class='c010'>So firmly was this principle subsequently
engrafted on our Colonial system,
that it became our strongest defence
against the encroachments of the Mother
Country during the Revolutionary struggle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>and gave us an effective <i>pou sto</i> for
the Declaration of Independence. Nor
did the severing of the relations with
the government of England rupture this
thread of law and equity which bound
us to our historic past. Ours became
the heritage of English Common Law:
ours as well as England’s those historic
rights and privileges of citizenship handed
down from Magna Charta.</p>

<p class='c010'>I answer, secondly, to Samuell Gorton
more than to any other, all generations
of Americans will owe the insistent
affirmation and consistent illustration of
the principle of religious individualism
which is the logical outcome of the
Protestant idea—the principle which
strips off the conventional reliance on
ritual and organization, and places the
individual soul face to face with the
problems of life and duty. In our own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>generation, Ralph Waldo Emerson has
been the clearest exponent of this principle.
Gorton was the premature John
the Baptist of New England Transcendentalism.</p>

<p class='c010'>No portrait, or adequate description
of this forgotten Founder of our Liberties
has been handed down to our time.
The writer of his brief biography tells
us that “His bearing was courteous, his
feelings lively, his mind vigorous and
well-informed.”<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c012'><sup>[80]</sup></a> From such hints as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>we may obtain from various sources we
may picture him as a man of tall stature,
marked features and gentlemanly address;
blue-eyed—a typical Saxon; of
an earnest and sympathetic nature; persuasive
of speech in conversation and
exhortation, and freely emphasizing his
thoughts with appropriate gestures, quick
to resent injustice, and bold in his denunciation
of wrong-doers,<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c012'><sup>[81]</sup></a>—more eloquent
and effective in his spontaneous utterances
and unstudied efforts than in the
formal and labored style of his written
treatises.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of his domestic life we know but
little. From his kindly mention of his
wife and children in the final disposal
of his property, we have a right to infer
that his family relations were harmonious.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>The reverent regard of his sons
for his wishes, long after his decease,
shows that the respect which they bore
for him was deep and lasting. Besides
the three sons, his family included twice
that number of daughters. These were
all married at the time of his decease,
and the fact that they, conjointly with
their husbands, were remembered in the
final disposal of his property indicates his
affectionate regard for all the branches of
his household. One of the daughters,
with the remarkable Scriptural name
of Mahershallalhashbaz, married Daniel
Cole, and removed to Glen Cove, Long
Island, then known as Moscheto Cove,
and has numerous descendants still residing
in that vicinity.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c012'><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>More than most men, Samuell Gorton
has been honored in the persons of his
descendants. His oldest son, Captain
Samuell Gorton, succeeded in some respects,
to the position and influence of
his father and held many posts of honor
in his Town and State. Benjamin, the
youngest son, was one of the founders
of the neighboring Town of East Greenwich.
Othniel Gorton, a lineal descendant
of Samuell Gorton, was several times
chosen to the General Assembly from
the Town of Warwick, and was Speaker
of the House of Representatives at intervals
during and subsequent to the Revolutionary
War. Gen. Nathaniel Greene,
next to George Washington, the most
eminent military leader in the contest
with Great Britain, traced his lineage
directly to John Greene and Samuell
Gorton, noble founders of the liberties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>which he fought to sustain; as did also
Col. Christopher Greene, of Revolutionary
fame. Albert Gorton Greene,
a descendant of John Greene, Samuell
Gorton and Randall Holden, three of
the original settlers of Warwick, became
a judge of the Municipal Court in the
City of Providence, and is well known
to three generations as the author of
“Old Grimes,” and other popular ballads
and poems. The late Governor
Henry Lippitt, and the present Chief
Magistrate of Rhode Island, the Hon.
Charles Warren Lippitt, as well as the
late Lieut.-Gov. Samuel G. Arnold, the
historian of the State, are direct descendants
of Samuell Gorton. The Rev.
James Gorton, a Baptist minister of independent
views now living, is a frequent
contributor on social and religious topics
to periodical literature. Dr. David
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Allyn Gorton, of Brooklyn, N.&nbsp;Y., another
living descendant of Samuell Gorton,
has won an enviable reputation in the
practice of medicine, was formerly editor
of the National Quarterly Review, is the
author of an able work on “The Monism
of Man,” and numerous philosophical
essays, as well as a treatise on “The
Principles of Mental Hygiene,” and
voluminous contributions to medical literature.
In recent years he has contributed
several able papers to the collections
of the Brooklyn Ethical Association.
His son, Dr. Eliot Gorton, is well
known as an alienist and an able writer
on this and kindred topics, as is also Dr.
W.&nbsp;A. Gorton, of the Butler Asylum
for the Insane, in Providence. Charles
Gorton, of the same city, who owns the
only complete original edition of Samuell
Gorton’s published works known to exist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>in this country, is a tireless bibliophilist
and book collector, the possessor of invaluable
literary and archæological treasures.
Dexter Gorton is one of the most
respected citizens of Providence, a man
of sterling integrity, for many years
Chief Engineer of the Fire Department
of that City, now one of its Fire Commissioners,
and has several times been
chosen to the City Council. The descendants
of Samuell Gorton are also
widely distributed in other portions of
the country. In the independence of
mind and literary ability which they
have often illustrated, the believer in
heredity will recognize the out-cropping
of the same sterling qualities which
characterized the first of their honored
name who made his home in the new
world.</p>

<p class='c010'>The house which Samuell Gorton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>erected and where he spent his later
years was a land-mark in Old Warwick
until within the last half century. From
its door his eyes could rest on the placid
waters of Warwick Cove, and beyond
the meadow could see his cattle grazing
upon the rounded uplands of Warwick
Neck. The surrounding scenery is restful
to the eye, and invites the thoughtful
contemplation of the deep things of life
in which his soul delighted. A short
time since, I visited the spot, and conversed
with the oldest representative of
four generations of his descendants, now
occupying the ancestral acres. I walked
up the hill-side back of the house which
now occupies the site of the old Gorton
homestead, to the little family graveyard
where tradition says that Samuell
Gorton was laid to rest with the patent
of the Town of Warwick which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>obtained in England,—a nobler decoration
than a royal order—upon his breast.
No monumental stone—not even a green
mound or an over-arching tree—now
marks the sacred bit of earth where his
body long since turned to dust.</p>

<p class='c010'>All around, however, are the gracious
evidences that his life and labors were
not vainly spent. The prosperity of the
town which he founded and the Commonwealth
which he helped to build,
constitute his most enduring monument.
South, lies the quiet hamlet of East
Greenwich, of which his son was one of
the founders, built in part upon land
once owned by Samuell Gorton. West,
also, lie the rural towns of Coventry
and West Greenwich, the soil of which
was largely covered by his original purchase
from Miantonomi. What fortunes
have been made where he found a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>wilderness and out of it wrought a humble
home for his declining years! What
untold happiness has filled the throbbing
hearts of the many generations
that have come after him as they have
looked out upon the pleasant acres,
honestly bought of their aboriginal possessors,
and bravely held as a heritage
to his posterity!</p>

<p class='c010'>The Commonwealth which he loved
and served so well has proudly held up
the banner of Soul Liberty guarded and
consecrated by Righteous Law, until its
beautiful symbol<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c012'><sup>[83]</sup></a> has carried Hope and
Safety to the uttermost parts of our
American Union. Could this Founder
of our Liberties look down upon these
peaceful and prosperous scenes, and ponder
upon their vast and beneficent significance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>hardly would his unselfish soul
miss the monumental stone which yet a
grateful community shall raise to his
fragrant memory. In thankfulness of
heart he would bless the Power which
has wrought so marvelously in him and
in those who have followed in his footsteps,
and murmur in grateful acknowledgment,
“Yea, Lord, I have seen of the
travail of my soul, and am satisfied.”</p>

of Samuell Gorton, being in New England,” of “all
the money which her said husband Samuell doth owe
me, and a breed of cattle which he hath of mine.” In
a later volume (XLVI), there is a record of the will of
“John Maplett, Doctor of Physicke, of the city of
Bath, Somerset,” dated April 16, 1670, which contains
the following clause: “I give and bequeath unto my
dear sister, Mistress Mary Gorton, of New England,
the sum of 20s., and to each of her children I give the
sum of 10s. apiece.” Dr. John Maplett, the brother-in-law
of Samuell Gorton, was eminent in letters as
well as in medicine, having been for a time the Principal
of Worcester College. (<i>Vide</i> Stevens’s Cyc. of Nat.
Biography.) Samuell Gorton’s oldest child was a
daughter named Mary, probably for her mother. His
youngest daughter was named Elizabeth, but the late
date of Dr. Maplett’s bequest to his sister Mary precludes
the idea of a second marriage. There appear
to have been at least two instances in the later history
of the Gorton family of marriages between Samuells
and Elizabeths, and it is probably from this that the
confusion has arisen. I am indebted to Mr. Adelos
Gorton, of Philadelphia, for important facts bearing
on this question.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f43'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r43'>43</a>. Williams probably sold his half of Prudence to
obtain money to pay his expenses to England, when
he went to make application for a charter. The purchase
was in the name of a friend and co-partner of
Winthrop, one Parker, a merchant of Boston.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f44'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r44'>44</a>. The date ordinarily assigned to this patent, “Aug.
19, <i>1644</i>,” must be erroneous. It was probably granted
two years later, when Gorton was in England.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f45'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r45'>45</a>. The manner in which the authorities of Massachusetts
Bay recognized this safe-conduct was characteristic.
Under date of “13th May, 1648,” the following
entry appears in the Colonial Records: “Vppon the
request of the Earle of Warwicke, the Court allowes
Samuell Gorton, now a shipboard, one full weeke after
the date hereof, for the transportatiō of himselfe &amp;
his goods through or iurisdictiō to the place of his
dwelling, he demeaning himselfe inoffensively, accordinge
to the contents of the Ŝd earle’s l’re, &amp; that the
marshals or some of them shall shew him a coppie of
this order, or fix it to the maine mast of the shippe in

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f46'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r46'>46</a>. Warwick was not named in the Charter, as the
town was not organized when it was granted; but it
united with the other towns in 1647, in the first General
Assembly of the entire Colony.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f47'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r47'>47</a>. These were the names given the contesting parties
of white men by the Indians. The latter, Roger Williams
says, means “coat wearers,” which leads Dr.
Fiske to query whether the Gortonists habitually went
in their shirt sleeves!</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f48'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r48'>48</a>. Peage, or wampum, was legal tender in Rhode
Island until 1662, and doubtless still passed current
among the Indians. The bill of sale bears the name of
Pomham’s son, but in its terms binds Pomham as well
as his heirs.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f49'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r49'>49</a>. The Charter of 1643-44 provided “that the laws,
constitutions, punishments for the civil government
of the said Plantation be conformable to the laws of
England so far as the nature and constitution of that
place would admit.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f50'>

to those of any other man in the Colony. He was

<p class='c010'><a href='#r78'>78</a>. It is hardly necessary to say that neither Gorton
or Parker held this doctrine in any materialistic sense.
It was a lofty philosophical conception that the entire
creative energy was expressed in the divine nature, to
conceive which as purely masculine was inadequate,
anthropomorphic and irrational.</p>

from the King, but that the natives are the true owners
of it and that wee ought to repent of such receiving it
by Pattent.” Gorton agreed with Williams as to the
necessity of purchase from the Indians, but thought
the charter also necessary.</p>

of the government he was almost constantly
in office, and during a long life there is no instance of
record to my knowledge of any reproach or censure
cast upon him, no complaint of him, although history
furnishes abundance of evidence that there were no lack
of enemies to his person, principles, or property. This
can hardly be said of any other settler of the Colony of
any standing.” Quoted in Judge Brayton’s “<i>Defence

<p class='c010'>The “Tax Lists of the Town of Providence” is a compilation
of original documents relating to taxation during the Administration
of <b>Sir Edmund Andros and his Council, 1686-1689</b>. It
comprises copies of warrants issued by order of the Council for
the assessment and collection of taxes, the tax lists or rate bills
prepared pursuant to these warrants, the returns made by the
townsmen of their ratable property, and the Tax Laws enacted
by Andros and his Council. All of these, with the exception
of the laws, are here printed for the first time.</p>

<p class='c010'>Among the rate bills is the list of polls for 1688, which contains
the <i>names of all males sixteen years of age and upwards
living in Providence in August of that year</i>; practically a census
of the town. For the genealogist and historian this volume contains
material of the greatest value on account of the great number
of names which these lists contain, besides showing the
amount of the tax assessment in each case.</p>

<p class='c010'>The returns of ratable property form a study by themselves,
for they tell in the quaint language of the colonists what they
possess, and therefore shed much light on the condition of the
times. For a study of this episode in New England Colonial
History this work is invaluable.</p>

<p class='c010'>The index of all names contained in the lists and text is a
feature of this work.</p>

<p class='c016'>An Historical and Architectural Study by <span class='sc'>Norman M. Isham</span>, Instructor
in Architecture, Brown University, and <span class='sc'>Albert F. Brown</span>,
Architect. Illustrated with a map and over fifty full-page plates.
$3.50, net.</p>

<p class='c009'>No feature in the study of the early life of New England is
more valuable or more interesting than the architecture. Nothing
throws more light on the home life of the colonists than
the knowledge of how they planned and built their dwellings.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Early Rhode Island Houses</b> gives a clear and accurate
account of the early buildings and methods of construction,
showing the historical development of architecture among the
Rhode Island colonists, the striking individuality in the work
of the colony and the wide difference between the buildings
here and the contemporary dwelling in Massachusetts and
Connecticut.</p>

<p class='c010'>Those interested in colonial life may here look into the early
homes of Rhode Island with their cavernous fireplaces and
enormous beams. The student will find in these old examples
a valuable commentary on New England history, while the
architect will discover in the measurements and analyses of
construction much of professional interest.</p>

<p class='c010'>Among the houses described are the Smith Garrison House
and the homesteads of the families of Fenner, Olney, Field,
Crawford, Waterman, Mowry, Arnold, Whipple, and Manton.</p>

<p class='c010'>A chapter is devoted to the early houses of Newport, which
were unlike those of the northern part of the State and resemble
the old work in the Hartford colony.</p>

<p class='c010'>Photographs and measurements of the dwellings have been
made, and from them careful plans, sections, and restorations
have been drawn; in some cases six full-page plates admirably
drawn and interesting in themselves have been devoted to a
single house. Several large plates give illustrations of framing
and other details. It is to be noted that these plates are made
from measured drawings, that the measurements are given on
the plates, and that these constitute in most if not all cases the
only exact records for a class of buildings which is destined to
disappear at no distant day. It is believed that these drawings,
and especially the restorations, will give a clearer idea than has
ever before been obtained of the early New England house. A
map enables the reader to locate without difficulty the houses
mentioned in the text.</p>

<p class='c010'>The authors have discussed the historical relation of Rhode
Island work to contemporary building in the other New England
colonies and in the mother country. The book is a mine of
authentic information on this subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>A list of the houses in the State built before 1725, so far as they
are known, with dates and a brief description will be found in
the appendix.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This book is probably the most valuable historic architectural
treatise that has as yet appeared in America.”—<i>The Nation.</i></p>

style of cartographic engraving by the United States Government
and furnished to the State. From these plates transfers were
made to stone and the maps printed in four colors, viz: The names,
roads, railroads and other culture features are in <i>black</i>. Rivers,
ponds, swamps and other water features are in <i>blue</i>. Contour lines
and figures denoting elevation are in <i>brown</i>. State, county and

<p class='c010'>Besides showing all bodies of water and watercourses, common
roads or highways and railroads, it has one feature distinct from
and superior to any map of the State hitherto published, viz:
Contour lines, drawn for each 20 feet of elevation above mean sea
level. Figures are placed upon the heavier contour lines which
denote elevations of 100 feet, 200 feet, etc., above mean sea level,
also upon hills and bodies of water to denote their elevation. A
contour line indicating 20 feet depth of water <i>below</i> mean sea level
is drawn along the coast. In a few cases figures are given to indicate
depths of water of less than 20 feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Atlas includes 12 maps and 10 pages index and statistics

<p class='c010'>For nearly three years the British Army was located within
the State and one of the notable battles was fought within its
territory. The war map of this battle of Rhode Island, now
preserved in the State archives, has been especially reproduced
for this work, and is shown in its entirety for the first time.</p>

<p class='c010'>The work is profusely illustrated with plans and views of
these old earthworks, together with illustrations of the styles
of equipments and fac-similes of enlistment papers for the Continental
Army. A Map of the State of Rhode Island is inserted
showing the location of each fort, beacon, and coast guard station
described in the text.</p>

than seven hundred officers and enlisted men, many of which
have been hitherto inaccessible, are here presented. The records
of Rhode Island Soldiers in the War of the Revolution are scattered

be of great assistance to those who desire to ascertain the service
of Rhode Island Soldiers, or to establish their right to membership
in the hereditary patriotic societies, for the names have
been carefully transcribed and reference is given in each case

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
